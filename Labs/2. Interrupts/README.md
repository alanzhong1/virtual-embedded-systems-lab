# Lab 2 Interrupts
In this lab we will be reading a button's input with Polling and Interrupts.

## Part 1 - Polling (40%)
In this part you have to toggle the Green LED based on when the User button (the blue button) is pressed. Use the file `part1.c` to write your code and then run it by selecting `Lab_2_Part_1` in the **Run Lab** task.

## Part 2 - Interrupts (60%)
In this part you have to toggle the Green LED based on User button press, but using interrupts. Use the file `part2.c` to write your code and then run it by selecting `Lab_1_Part_2` in the **Run Lab** task.
