# Virtual Embedded Systems Lab
In this lab we will introduce you to some tasks that you will likely perform when you start working as an embedded systems engineer. We will cover the following in these labs:
1. GPIO Output
2. GPIO Input based on polling and interrupts
3. Emulating SPI using GPIO, for when a hardware SPI is not present in a device
4. Writing a device driver for a peripheral attached with SPI
5. Writing a state machine based orchestration system

But before we jump in let's Setup our systems so that we can run the labs themselves.

## Setup
1. Install Docker
    1. Install Docker-compose
2. Install VSCode
3. Install Remote Containers extension for VSCode
4. Open the folder using VSCode containers
5. Verify that you can use VNC
6. Verify that you can run the simulator
